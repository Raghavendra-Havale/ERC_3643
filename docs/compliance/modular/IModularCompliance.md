| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _module | address | address of the module to remove  This function can be called ONLY by the owner of the compliance contract  Emits a ModuleRemoved event |

### transferred

```solidity
function transferred(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) external nonpayable
```



*function called whenever tokens are transferred  from one wallet to another  this function can update state variables in the modules bound to the compliance  these state variables being used by the module checks to decide if a transfer  is compliant or not depending on the values stored in these state variables and on  the parameters of the modules  This function can be called ONLY by the token contract bound to the compliance*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _from | address | The address of the sender |
| _to | address | The address of the receiver |
| _amount | uint256 | The amount of tokens involved in the transfer  This function calls moduleTransferAction() on each module bound to the compliance contract |

## Events

### ModuleAdded

```solidity
event ModuleAdded(address indexed _module)
```

this event is emitted when a module has been added to the list of modules bound to the compliance contract  the event is emitted by the addModule function  `_module` is the address of the compliance module



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

### ModuleInteraction

```solidity
event ModuleInteraction(address indexed target, bytes4 selector)
